title: Learning English with Mourinho

I really appreciate Mourinho. He not only bring something different for football, but also teach other things to us. I use English in title, but what I learn and what I want to express is beyond English itself.

### "A dream, not a obsession"

You can found the video on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1n541137XA?from=search&seid=4680931744323157835&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) and [the link](https://www.inter.it/en/news/2010/04/27/mourinho-a-dream-not-an-obsession.html). If you are Guardiola, what will you do? It is really hard.

>We have the dream of winning the Champions League and for Bacelona it's an obsession. This is the difference. A dream is purer than an obsession. There is pride in a dream, anywhere in the world. For Bacelona it was a dream to reach the final in Rome, but to reach the final at the Bernabeu is obsession for them. 

### "The major Difference between a captain and a leader"

You can found the video on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15y4y1U74K?from=search&seid=10512272499074489393&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) and [the link](https://www.sportbible.com/football/news-mourinho-explains-the-major-difference-between-a-captain-and-a-leader-20191215). It goes without saying that I totally agree with him, and I also found that leader is miused in my company.

Frankly speaking, I donnot know why he is not magic now, and I cannot accept any simple explanation. Meanwhile, it is not important whether he can become magic again, but I always appreciate him because he can bring some difference to me, and make me thinking about something in depth.
