## Motivation
When I was young, I am facinated with soccer stars, saying Maldini, Raul, and so on. Though I am still interested with them and latest players, I pay more attention to soccer managers, including Ancelotti, Mourinho, Bielsa, etc. I think there are two reasons behind it. Firstly, I becomes older. Secondly, I am a software manager and I found there are many similarity between them. I believe my team will become better if I can take full advantage of each member just as Ancelotti, have a solid methology as Mourinho, have endless passion as Bielsa.
Here I use manager instead of coach, because I think it will be more intact.
Software management evovles a lot in the past decades. Agile, one branch of software management methodlogy, has become the protagonist of PMP certification. Except for software itself, Agile pay more attention to human. As the biggerest sports in the world and a classic teamwork, I believe we can learn a lot from soccer.

## Similarity

TODO: I found it is hard to list all similarities, because those things also existed in other management activities.

## Building a team
Building a team is the core responsibility of any manager, 


## How to improve the ability of the team?
In soccer world, it is not possible to have the best players on each position.

## What we can learn from soccer manager?

### Mourinho

The most things I want to know is why Mourinho seems out-of-date in the past decades. 


His Chelsea is unbeatable between 2004 and 2007, and maybe only Massimo Moratti can understand the difficulty for Inter Milan to win Euro Champion. At that time, I believe he will dominate Euro soccer for a long time. 


His magic disappear after he left Real Madrid. The memory in Manchester and Tottenham is painful. I donot know whether Alex Fregson has considered him as his successor when he met Mourinho's Chelsea, I believe he cannot image what happened on Mourinho's Manchester United. Tottenham even destroy his record of winning at least one cup in any club by firing him just before the FA final.


Most people said Mourinho's tatics is obsolete, but I donnot think so. Nowadays, maybe Guardiola has most innocation in tatics, but he still donot have much advantage over others.


So I believe something wrong, but why it happens in different clubs? I really want to know it.


### Ancelotti


For Ancelotti, I preferred to use coach instead of manager, because it seems he never try to manage transfer. Even so, he is still one of the best. In 2022, Ancelotti becomes the first coach who won champions in all top 5 leagues. It is unbelievable.


As a team, you need different type of players.

Most coaches has their preferred tactics, saying 4-4-2, 3-5-2, and so on, and they have to choose suitable players for each position. Ancelotti is differnt, his tactics always changes according to the player he have.
