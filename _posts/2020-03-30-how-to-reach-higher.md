title: How to reach higher
---
Today, we were notified that at least one paper should be accepted by top conference.
Frankly speaking, it is not possible if we consider our human resource carefully. Since "Root deep, reach high" is the motto of our institute, let's discuss how to reach higher.

Firstly, you should know where you are, and where you should be. Please keep in mind the distance cannot be measured simply by Euclidean distance, and several hard leaps are needed. The best way is try to understand a master in your field just like the following Zen poem:
>To follow the path:

>look to the master,

>follow the master,

>walk with the master,

>see through the master,

>become the master.

If the talk/paper/essay of the master can inspire you to think something, you are on the right way. However you still cannot fully understand the master because you donnot have enough background knowledge. Don't worry too much since it is very common. Learn anything when needed. This step is really tough and important. 

After you have learnt some background, please re-visit the talk/paper/essay of the master again and again. Each time you will find some new things. It will be a great achievement when you totally understand it.
