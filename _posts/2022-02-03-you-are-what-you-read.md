title: You are what you read and what you say?
---
It is an unusual day for me. It is Spring Festival Holiday, my wife takes my son to his friend's home, so I have a day which belongs to me, which has not happen for several years.

Today I watched some videos from Bilibili. I learnt something which is not known before. I think it will definitely impact my following thinking and decision. This is the reason why you are what you read.

Without further reading, you will only think in your original way, which may be less efficiency or even wrong.

From another perspective, you are also what you say. What you say maybe not what you think, but it is something you accepted.
