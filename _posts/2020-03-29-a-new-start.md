title: A new start
---
I have tried to write blogs several times in the past decades, and all of them are abandoned. 
I restarted to write blogs because the following reasons:
1. After working for fifteen years, I have a good understanding for work, computer science, life, and so on. I have enough material to write down, and I also hope blog can help me.
2. I want to be a good example to my son.
