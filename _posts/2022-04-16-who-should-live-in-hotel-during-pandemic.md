title: Who should live in the hotel for working during pandemic
---
Omicron, the latest variant of COVID-19, brings the whole city into another panic, especially after the goverment announced a four-day special control.


To cope with the risk, HR team asked a list who can work in company and stay in the hotel if the whole city is lockdown. Every project provided a list with one or two members except for me.


I cannot stay in the hotel because I have to take care of my son, and nobody feedback.

I cannot persude me to call anyone. If he asked why, I have no answer. 
- The member who has child is exemption, and other member is deserved for more. why the company pay us with the same standardï¼Ÿ
- I am OK for this time, and who should be the person for next lockdown? The member wwho cannot come this time still cannot come next time.

Without the list, I think the HR team will simple give me a negative comment. Frankly speaking, I also feel tired with those requirements.
