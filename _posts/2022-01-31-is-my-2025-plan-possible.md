title: Is my 2025 plan possible?
---
It is Jan. 31, 2022.
It is seven o'clock.
It is the first day of Spring Festival holiday.
It is a morning after a sleepless night.


Maybe two years ago, Xi'an was elected as the host city of ICCV 2025.
I set up a goal for me: Try to make more member to participate in it, which means we have to publish several papers on top conference before that.


Three things happens in the past months:
- One paper is accepted by ICASSP
- Two papers have good chance for CVPR
- Three members asked to quit the company.


From the first and second items, we can see hope for the 2025 plan. However, the third one made it tough. Frankly speaking, I am not quite sure whether chain reaction will be triggered.

I am not quite sure whether the 2025 plan is possible, but I will never give up.
