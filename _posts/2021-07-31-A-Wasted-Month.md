title: A wasted month?
---
My son finished his second grade by the end of June, and the summer holiday starts.

The exam result is not satisfactory. The math score is 98 and those 2 points are lost with the easist ones. In Chinese exam, he only get 94 points and the highest score is 99.5.

However, I still think he has a good foundation already and hope he can learn to manage himself in the holiday. So I asked him to finished the summer holiday homework by July. I will not check the progress and only will check the result on 7/31.

The result is not good, he only finished about 1/4 of it. I asked him to explain, he only said copying Chinese letters takes some much times.

I told the following things to him.

> I knew he want to have a new bicycle, and I has already choose one for him. However, I am waiting for a chance.

> The exam is a chance. If he can get full mark for both math and English, and his Chinese score is similar to the highest score (less than 2 scores), I will buy the new bicycle. However we miss it.

> Finish the summer holiday homework by July is another chance. If he can finish it with good quality by July, I will buy the new bicycle. However, we missed it again.

> You should care your study by yourself, and get the score you deserve.

> You are smart enough, and I am confident I am better than most parents on education. then why we cannot get a satisfactory score?

> I always try to minimize the homework. The math teacher asked to do calulus everyday, and the Chinese teacher asked to do the reading exercise of forth grade. I have not asked you to do them. However, you need to finish the homework assigned by me.

I think he got something I want he knows. If so, I think the past month is not wasted.
