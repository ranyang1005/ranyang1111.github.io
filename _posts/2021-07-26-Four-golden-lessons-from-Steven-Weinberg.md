title: Four golden lessons from Steven Weinberg
---

Steven Weinberg passed away recently. From the blogs, I found he has written an essay for new Ph.D., which is very meaningful for me. 

> 1. No one knows everything, and you don't have to.
> 2. Go for the messes - that's where the action is.
> 3. Forgive yourself for wasting time.
> 4. Learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science.
